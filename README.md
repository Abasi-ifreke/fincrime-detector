# Financial Crime Detector

## Overview
The **Financial Crime Detector** is a robust, scalable, and real-time system designed to detect potentially fraudulent transactions.  
By combining sophisticated rule-based detection with machine learning techniques, this system provides early warnings to financial institutions, helping to prevent fraud and minimize financial losses.

This system incorporates **Elasticsearch** for powerful data analysis and storage, along with a **Go-based backend** for efficient processing.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Transaction Analysis**: Processes and analyzes transactions as they occur, providing immediate feedback.
- **Rule-Based Detection**: Uses a flexible rule engine to identify suspicious activities based on predefined criteria.
- **Elasticsearch Integration**: Stores and indexes transaction data and alerts for efficient querying, analysis, and visualization.
- **Go-Based Backend**: High-performance backend built with Go for efficient transaction processing and alert generation.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Stores detection rules and persistent data.
- **Kibana Visualization**: User-friendly interface for visualizing alerts and transaction data.
- **Logstash Integration**: Data processing and enrichment before reaching Elasticsearch.
- **Metrics and Monitoring**: Exposes Prometheus metrics for system performance monitoring.
- **Dockerized Deployment**: Easy deployment with Docker and Docker Compose.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging using Logrus.
- **Secure Authentication**: Basic authentication for API endpoints.
- **CORS Support**: Correctly configured CORS to allow requests from the frontend.

## Architecture
The system architecture is designed for scalability, reliability, and maintainability. It includes the following components:
- **Frontend**: A web-based user interface (likely built with React) for submitting transactions and viewing alerts.
- **Backend**: A Go-based application that handles transaction processing, fraud detection, and communication with databases and Elasticsearch.
- **PostgreSQL**: A relational database for storing detection rules and application data.
- **Elasticsearch**: A distributed search and analytics engine for storing and indexing transactions and alerts.
- **Kibana**: A visualization tool for exploring and analyzing data stored in Elasticsearch.
- **Logstash**: A data processing pipeline that collects, transforms, and ships data into Elasticsearch.

## Design Considerations

- **Scalability**: Designed to handle high volumes of transactions using Elasticsearch’s distributed architecture and Go’s concurrency features.
- **Real-time Performance**: Elasticsearch enables fast indexing and querying of transactions and alerts.
- **Extensibility**: New detection rules can be easily added to the PostgreSQL database without requiring code changes.
- **Maintainability**: Modular architecture with comprehensive logging simplifies maintenance and debugging.
